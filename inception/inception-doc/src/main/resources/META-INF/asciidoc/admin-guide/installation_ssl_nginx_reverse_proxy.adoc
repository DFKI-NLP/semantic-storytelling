= Putting it all together

By now you should have

* {product-name} running on port 8080
* NGINX running with default configurations on port 80
* your issued SSL certificates

NOTE: If you are running {product-name} on a different port than 8080, please make sure to adjust the configurations below accordingly!

We will now configure NGINX to proxy pass all traffic received at `example.com/inception` to our {product-name} instance.

Create a new virtual host for your domain. Inside of `/etc/nginx-sites-available/` create a new file for your domain (e.g. `example.com`). Paste the following contents:
----
# Server block for insecure http connections on port 80. Redirect to https on port 443
server {
        listen          80;
        listen          [::]:80;
        server_name     example.com;
        return          301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

# Server block for secure https connections
server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        listen [::]:443 ssl;
        server_name inception.example.com;

        ssl on;

        # Replace certificate paths
        ssl_certificate         /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key     /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;
        ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;

        # Modern SSL Config from
        # https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/
        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;
        ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256';
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
        ssl_session_timeout 1d;
        ssl_session_tickets off;
        add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=15768000;
        ssl_stapling on;
        ssl_stapling_verify on;

        ignore_invalid_headers off; #pass through headers from INCEpTION which are considered invalid by NGINX server.

        # Change body size if needed. This defines the maximum upload size for files.
        client_max_body_size    10M;

        # Uncommend this for a redirect from example.com to example.com/inception
        #location / {
        #    return 301 https://$host/inception;
        #}

        location ^~ /inception/ {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/inception/;
            proxy_redirect default;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;

            proxy_set_header   Host             $host;
            proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_max_temp_file_size 0;

            proxy_connect_timeout      180;
            proxy_send_timeout         180;
            proxy_read_timeout         180;

            proxy_temp_file_write_size 64k;

            # Required for new HTTP-based CLI
            proxy_request_buffering off;
            proxy_buffering off; # Required for HTTP-based CLI to work over SSL
            proxy_set_header Connection ""; # Clear for keepalive
    }

    # Deny access to Apache .htaccess files. They have no special meaning for NGINX and might leak sensitive information
    location ~ /\.ht {
            deny all;
    }
}
----

Create a symlink for the new configuration file to the folder for accessible websites:
----
$ ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com
----

Test if the NGINX configuration file works without restarting (and possibly breaking) the webserver:
----
$ nginx -t
Output:
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
----

If the config works restart the webserver to enable the new site
----
$ service nginx restart
----

= Tell {product-name} that it is running behind a proxy

If you are running {product-name} via the JAR file, edit the `settings.properties` file to add these
settings:

----
server.tomcat.internal-proxies=127\.0\.[0-1]\.1
server.tomcat.remote-ip-header=x-forwarded-for
server.tomcat.accesslog.request-attributes-enabled=true
server.tomcat.protocol-header=x-forwarded-proto
server.tomcat.protocol-header-https-value=https
----

Restart {product-name}
----
$ service inception restart
----

{product-name} now knows how to interpret the proxy header fields from NGINX. With this step, everything is now set up to access {product-name} trough a secure https connection.

= CSRF protection

Depending on your situation, you may get an error message such as this when trying to use
{product-name}.

[example]
====
Whitelabel Error Page
This application has no explicit mapping for /error, so you are seeing this as a fallback.

Fri Nov 29 14:01:15 BRT 2019
There was an unexpected error (type=Bad Request, status=400).
Origin does not correspond to request
====

If this is the case, then CSRF protection is kicking in. What seems to work in this case is to turn
off CSRF entirely by adding the following lines to your `settings.properties` file (see <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_settings>>):

----
wicket.core.csrf.enabled=false
wicket.core.csrf.no-origin-action=allow
wicket.core.csrf.conflicting-origin-action=allow
----

NOTE: **Turning off a security feature is obviously not a great solution.** Better check out the documentation for the link:https://github.com/MarcGiffing/wicket-spring-boot/blob/master/README.adoc#core---prevention-of-csrf-attacks[Wicket Spring Boot CSRF settings] and if you figure out a better solution than the above, please get in touch with use via our 
      link:https://github.com/inception-project/inception/issues[issue tracker].
