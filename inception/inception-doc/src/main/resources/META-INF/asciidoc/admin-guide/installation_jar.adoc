= Running via embedded Tomcat (JAR)

The {product-name} standalone JAR with an embedded Tomcat server and can be easily set up as a 
UNIX service. This is the recommended way of running {product-name} on a server. 

The instructions below expect a Debian Linux system. Details may vary on other OSes and Linux
distributions.

== Installing as a service

To set it up as a service, you can do the following steps. For the following
example, we assume that you install {product-name} in `/srv/inception`:

* Copy the standalone JAR file `inception-app-standalone-{revnumber}.jar` to `/srv/inception/inception.jar`.
   Note the change of the filename to `inception.jar`.
* Create the file `/srv/inception/inception.conf` with the following content
+
[source,text]
----
JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.awt.headless=true -Dinception.home=/srv/inception"
----
+
* In the previous step, you have already created the `/srv/inception/settings.properties` file. 
  You *may optionally* configure the Tomcat port using the following line
+
[source,text]
----
server.port=18080
----
+
If you need to do additional configurations of the embedded Tomcat, best refer to the 
documentation of Spring Boot itself.
+
* Make sure that the file `/srv/inception/inception.conf` is owned by the root user. If this is
  not the case, {product-name} will ignore it and any settings made there will not have any effect. If
  you start {product-name} and instead of using the MySQL database, it is using an embedded database,
  then you should double-check that `/srv/inception/inception.conf` is owned by the root user.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ chown root:root /srv/inception/inception.conf
----
+
* We will run {product-name} as the user `www-data`. Change the owner/group of `/srv/inception/inception.jar` to `www-data`.
  **Do NOT run {product-name} as root.**
+
[source,bash]
----
$ chown www-data:www-data /srv/inception/inception.jar
----
+
* Make the JAR file executable:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ chmod +x /srv/inception/inception.jar
----
+
* Create a file in `/etc/systemd/system/inception.service` with the following content:
+
[source,bash]
----
[Unit]
Description=INCEpTION

[Service]
ExecStart=/srv/inception/inception.jar
User=www-data

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----
+
* Enable the {product-name} service using
+
[source,bash]
----
$ systemctl enable inception
----
+
* Start {product-name} using
+
[source,bash]
----
$ systemctl start inception
----
+
* Check the log output
+
[source,bash]
----
$ journalctl -u inception
----
+
* Stop {product-name} using
+
[source,bash]
----
$ systemctl stop inception
----

== Running the standalone behind HTTPD

These are *optional* instructions if you want to run {product-name} behind an Apache web-server instead
of accessing it directly. This assumes that you already have the following packages installed:

* Apache Web Server
* mod_proxy
* mod_proxy_ajp

* Add the following lines to `/srv/inception/settings.properties`:
+
[source,text]
----
server.ajp.port=18009
server.ajp.secret=SECRET_STRING_YOU_CHOOSE
server.ajp.address=127.0.0.1
server.servlet.context-path=/inception
server.use-forward-headers=true
----
+
* Edit `/etc/apache2/conf.d/inception.local.conf`
+
[source,xml]
----
ProxyPreserveHost On

<Proxy ajp://localhost/inception >
  Order Deny,Allow
  Deny from none
  Allow from all
</Proxy>

<Location /inception >
  ProxyPass ajp://localhost:18009/inception timeout=1200 secret="SECRET_STRING_YOU_CHOOSE"
  ProxyPassReverse http://localhost/inception
</Location>
----
* Restart Apache web server
+
[source,bash]
----
$ service apache2 restart
----

NOTE: The `secret` option is supported e.g. in link:https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/
       mod_proxy_ajp.html[Apache HTTP 2.5 mod_proxy_ajp]. If you are using reverse proxy which does not	
       support passing along a secret, you may set `server.ajp.secret-required=false` in the 
       `settings.properties` file.
