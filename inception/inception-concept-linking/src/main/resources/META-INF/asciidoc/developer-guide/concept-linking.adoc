= Concept Linking

The concept linking module is used to find items from a knowledge base that match a certain query
and context. It is used e.g. by the `ConceptFeatureEditor` to display items which match a concept
mention and it can use the mention's context to rank (and optimally disambiguate) the candidate
items. It can also be used for non-contextualized queries, e.g. via the search field on the 
knowledge base browsing page. The module consists of the following classes and interfaces:

* The `ConceptLinkingService` interface and its default implementation `ConceptLinkingServiceImpl` which
  is the main entry point for locating KB items.
* The `EntityRankingFeatureGenerator` interface. Spring beans which implement this interface are
  automatically picked up by the `ConceptLinkingServiceImpl` and used to rank candidates.

== Ranking

=== Feature generators

The module currently uses primarily the `LevenshteinFeatureGenerator` which calculate the Levenshtein
distance between the mention text and the KB item label as well as between the query text (e.g.
entered into the auto-complete field of the `ConceptFeatureEditor`) and the KB item label.

=== Ranking strategy

The ranking method is currently hard-coded in `ConceptLinkingServiceImpl.baseLineRankingStrategy()`.

== Named entity linking recommender

The module also includes the `NamedEntityLinker` recommender which can be used to generate annotation
recommendations. It gets triggered for any `NamedEntity` annotations and suggests which KB items to
link them to.
