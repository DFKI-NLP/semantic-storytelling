= Event Log

The event logging module allows catching Spring events and logging them them to the
database. It consists of the following classes and interfaces:

* The `EventRepository` interface and its default implementation `EventRepositoryImpl` which
  serve as the data access layer for logged events.
* The `EventLoggingListener` which hooks into Spring, captures events, and then uses the
  `EventRepository` to log them.
* The `EventLoggingAdapter` interface. Spring components implementing this interface are 
  used to extract information from Spring events and to convert them into a format
  suitable to be logged.
* The `LoggedEvent` entity class which maps the logged events to the database.
* The `LoggedEventExporter` and `ExportedLoggedEvent` which are used to export/import the
  event log as part of a project export/import.

The log module comes with a number of adapters for common events such as annotation 
manipulation, changes to the project configuration, etc. Any event for which no specific
adapter exists is handled using the `GenericEventAdapter` which logs only general 
information (e.g. the timestamp, current user, type of event) but no event-specific 
details (e.g. current project, current document, or even more specific details). Note that
even the `GenericEventAdapter` skips logging certain Spring events related to session 
management, authorization, and the Spring context life-cycle.
