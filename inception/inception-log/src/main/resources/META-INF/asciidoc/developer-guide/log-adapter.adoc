= Event Logging Adapters

New logging adapters should be created in the module which provides the event they are logging.
Logging adapters for events generated outside {product-name} (i.e. in upstream code) are usually
added to the log module itself.

To add support for a logging a new event, create a Spring component class which implements the
`EventLoggingAdapter` interface. Implement the following methods depending on the context in which
the event is triggered:

* `getProject(Event)` if the event is triggered in the context of a specific project (applies to most
  events);
* `getDocument(Event)` if the event is related to a specific source document (e.g. applies to
  events triggered during annotation).
* `getDocument(Event)` if the event is related to a specific annotator (e.g. applies to
  events triggered during annotation).

The methods `getEvent`, `getUser` and `getCreated` normally do not need to be implemented.

Most event adapters implement the `getDetails` method. This method must return a JSON string which
contains any relevant information about the event not covered by the methods above. E.g. for an
annotation manipulation event, it would contain information helping to identify the annotation and
the state before and after the manipulation. In order to generate this JSON string, the adapter
typically contains an inner class called `Details` to which the detail information from the event
is copied and which is then serialized to JSON using `JSONUtil.toJsonString(...)`.
