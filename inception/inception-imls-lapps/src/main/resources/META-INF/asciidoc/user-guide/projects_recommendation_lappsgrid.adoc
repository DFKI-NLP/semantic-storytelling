== LAPPS Grid

This recommender allows to use LAPPS Grid web-services to generate predictions. Only services
taking the inputs are supported:

.Inputs
* Text
* Tokens
* Sentences

Furthermore, the services must produce annotations on one of the following built-in layers:

.Outputs
* Part-of-speech
* Lemma
* Named entity

The recommender comes with a list of pre-configured services that can be conveniently chosen from.
However, note that these services use versioned URLs and as LAPPS Grid evolves, these the services
might be upgrade and become available under different URLs.
