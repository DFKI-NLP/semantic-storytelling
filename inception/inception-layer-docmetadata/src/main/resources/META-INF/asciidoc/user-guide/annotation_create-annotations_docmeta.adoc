= Document metadata

NOTE: This is an experimental feature not recommended for serious use. In 
      particular, curation of document metadata annotations is not possible and they are not supported
      by the TSV format. They can be im-/exported via XMI or Binary CAS though. However, you can try it out
      and enable it by adding `documentmetadata.enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file (see <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_settings_documentmetadata>>). 

Before being able to configure document-level annotations, you need to define an annotation layer of 
type *Document metadata* on the project *Settings*, *Layers* tab. For this:

* Go to *Settings -> Layers* and click the *Create* button
* Enter a name for the annotation layer (e.g. `Author`) and set its type to *Document metadata*
* Click *Save*
* On the right side of the page, you can now configure features for this annotation layer by clicking *Create*
* Again, choose a name and type for the feature e.g. `name` of type *Primitive: String*
* Click *Save*

On the annotation page, you can now:

* Open the **Document Metadata sidebar** (the tags icon) and
* Choose the newly created annotation layer in the dropdown.
* Clicking the plus sign will add a new annotation whose feature you can fill in.
