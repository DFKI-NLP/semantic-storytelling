= Document Metadata

A document metadata layer can be used to create annotations that apply to an entire document
instead of to a specific span of text.

Document metadata types inherit from the UIMA `AnnotationBase` type (text annotations inherit from
`Annotation`). As such, they do not have begin/end offsets.
