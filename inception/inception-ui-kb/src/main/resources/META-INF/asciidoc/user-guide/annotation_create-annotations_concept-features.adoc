= Concept features

Concept features are shown as an auto-complete field. Typing into the field triggers a query against
the knowledge base and displays candidates in a dropdown list.

.Filtering by description
The query entered into the field only matches against the label of the knowledge base items, not
against their description. However, you can filter the candidates by their description. E.g. if you
wish to find all knowledge base items with `Obama` in the label and `president` in the description,
then you can write `Obama :: president`. A case-insensitive matching is being used.

.Substring matching
Depending on the knowledge base and full-text mode being used, there may be fuzzy matching. To
filter the candidate list down to those candidates which contain a particular substring, put
double quotes around the query, e.g. `"County Carlow"`. A case-insensitive matching is being used.
