= External search sidebar

The external search functionality can be used in the sidebar of the annotation page as well and
can be opened by clicking on the globe-logo on the sidebar at the left of the annotation page.
It essentially offers the same functionality as the external search page accessible via the project dashboard.
Being able to search directly from the annotation page may be more convenient though because the user does not
have to keep switching between the search page and the annotation page. Additionally, clicking on a search
result in the external search sidebar automatically imports the document into your project
and opens it in the annotation view.
