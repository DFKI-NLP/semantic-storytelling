= Schema mapping

An IRI Schema defines the following attributes that are used for making queries in a knowledge base.

.Schema Mapping Attributes
[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
| Attribute
| Description
| Example Value

| Class IRI
| Class of resources that are classes.
| rdfs:Class

| Subclass IRI
| Property that defines a *subclass of* relation between classes.
| rdfs:subClassOf

| Type IRI
| Property that defines which class a resource belongs to
| rdf:type

| Label IRI
| Property that defines a human readable label for a class or instance
| rdfs:label

| Description IRI
| Property that defines a description for a class or instance
| rdfs:comment

| Property IRI
| Class of resources that are properties
| rdf:Property

| Subproperty IRI
| Property that defines a *subproperty of* relation between properties.
| rdfs:subPropertyOf

| Property Label IRI
| Property that defines a human readable label for a property
| rdfs:label

| Property Description IRI

|===

There are multiple classes in the knowledge base module that model the IRI Schema of a knowledge 
base. All the classes share that they have a single class-attribute for each IRI in the IRI Schema.
However each class has a different use case. The relevant classes are shown <<KBClasses, here>>.

NOTE: If the structure of the general IRI Schema is changed (e.g. a new attribute is added) all 
      the classes need to be adjusted.*

.Knowledge base & schema mapping classes
[#KBClasses, cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
| Class
| Usage

| `KnowledgeBase`
| General model for a knowledge base in frontend and backend components.

| `KnowledgeBaseProfile` and  `KnowledgeBaseMapping`
| Read pre-configured knowledge base profiles from a yaml file.
  The actual IRI Schema is modeled in KnowledgeBaseMapping.java.
  The yaml file is located at: `.../inception-kb/src/main/resources/de/tudarmstadt/ukp/inception/kb/knowledgebase-profiles.yaml`

| `SchemaProfile`
| Defines some specific IRI Schemas (e.g RDF, WIKIDATA, SKOS).

| `ExportedKnowledgeBase`
| Export a knowledge base configuration when a project is exported.
