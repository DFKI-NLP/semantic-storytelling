= Search

The search  module contains the basic methods that implement the search service and search 
functionalities of {product-name}.

The `SearchService` and `SearchServiceImpl` classes define and implement the search service as a Spring component, allowing other modules of {product-name} to create an index for a given project, and to perform queries over that index.

The indexes have two different aspects: the conceptual index, represented by the Index class, and the physical index, represented by a particular physical implementation of an index. This allows different search providers to be used by INCEpTION. Currently, the default search implementation uses Mtas (https://github.com/meertensinstituut/mtas), a Lucene / Solr based index engine that allows to annotate not only raw texts but also different linguistic annotations.

Every search provider is defined by its own index factory, with a general index registry to hold all the available search providers.
