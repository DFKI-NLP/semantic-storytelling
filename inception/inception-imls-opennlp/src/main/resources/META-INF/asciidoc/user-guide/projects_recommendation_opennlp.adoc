== Sentence Classifier (OpenNLP Document Categorizer)

This recommender is available for sentence-level annotation layers where cross-sentence annotations
are disabled. It learns labels using a sentence-level bag-of-word model using the OpenNLP Document Categorizer. 

== Token Sequence Classifier (OpenNLP POS)

This recommender uses the OpenNLP Part-of-Speech Tagger to learn a token-level sequence tagging
model for layers that anchor to single tokens. The model will attempt to assign a label to every
single token. The model considers all sentences for training in which at least a one annotation
with a feature value exists. 

== Multi-Token Sequence Classifier (OpenNLP NER)

This recommender uses the OpenNLP Name Finder to learn a sequence tagging model for multi-token
annotations. The model generates a BIO-encoded representation of the annotations in the sentence.

NOTE: If a layer contains overlapping annotations, it considers only the first overlapping 
      annotation and then skips all annotation until it reaches one that does not overlap with it.
